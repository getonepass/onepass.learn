## Introduction

A holder wallet is a digital wallet that stores and manages your verifiable credentials. It is a key component of the OnePass ecosystem, as it allows you to store, manage, and present your credentials in a secure and user-friendly way.

When choosing a holder wallet, there are several factors to consider, including security, privacy, usability, and interoperability. In this guide, we will explore the key features to look for in a holder wallet and provide recommendations for popular wallets that are compatible with OnePass.

## Key Features of a Holder Wallet

### 1. **Security**

Security is a critical aspect of any holder wallet. Look for wallets that offer robust encryption, biometric authentication, and secure storage mechanisms to protect your credentials from unauthorized access.

### 2. **Privacy**

Privacy is another essential consideration when choosing a holder wallet. Ensure that the wallet gives you full control over your data and allows you to selectively disclose information without compromising your privacy.

### 3. **Usability**

A user-friendly interface and intuitive design are key factors in selecting a holder wallet. Choose a wallet that is easy to navigate, supports multiple languages, and provides clear instructions on how to manage your credentials.

### 4. **Interoperability**

Interoperability is crucial for seamless integration with OnePass and other decentralized identity platforms. Select a wallet that supports industry standards such as W3C's Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to ensure compatibility with various services.

### 5. **Compatibility**

Ensure that the holder wallet you choose is compatible with OnePass and other verifiable credential issuers. Check the list of supported wallets on the OnePass website to find wallets that meet the platform's requirements.
