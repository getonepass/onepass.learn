# How Decentralized Identity Works

Decentralized identity (DID) is a new paradigm that allows individuals and organizations to control and manage their own digital identities without relying on a central authority. It leverages cryptographic techniques and decentralized technologies to provide secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving digital identities.

## Key Components of Decentralized Identity

Decentralized identity is built on three fundamental components:

### 1. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**

DIDs are unique, self-owned identifiers that are not tied to a central registry or authority. Unlike traditional usernames or email-based identities, DIDs are generated and managed by users. They are stored on decentralized networks such as blockchain, making them immutable and verifiable.

### 2. **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**

Verifiable credentials are digital attestations issued by trusted entities (e.g., governments, universities, financial institutions). These credentials can be presented to third parties and verified cryptographically without requiring direct communication with the issuer. Examples include:

- Proof of identity
- Educational certificates
- Business registration documents

### 3. **Decentralized Identity Wallets**

Users store their DIDs and verifiable credentials in decentralized identity wallets, which are secure applications that enable identity management. Wallets allow users to selectively share their credentials while maintaining full control over their personal data.

## How It Works: The Identity Lifecycle

The decentralized identity model operates through a simple lifecycle:

1. **Issuance** – A trusted entity (issuer) generates and provides a verifiable credential to the user’s identity wallet.
2. **Storage & Control** – The user securely stores the credential in their wallet and maintains full control over it.
3. **Verification** – When required, the user presents their credential to a verifier (e.g., a service provider), who checks its authenticity using cryptographic proof without needing to contact the issuer.

This trust model eliminates the need for centralized identity providers, reducing risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Benefits of Decentralized Identity

- **User Control & Privacy** – Individuals manage their own identities without relying on third parties.
- **Security & Fraud Prevention** – Cryptographic proofs ensure authenticity, preventing identity fraud and credential forgery.
- **Interoperability** – DIDs and VCs are designed to work across different platforms and industries.
- **Efficiency & Cost Reduction** – Streamlines identity verification processes, reducing administrative burdens and compliance costs.

## Real-World Applications

- **Secure Online Authentication** – Eliminates the need for passwords by enabling decentralized login systems.
- **KYC & Financial Services** – Simplifies and speeds up Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for banks and fintech services.
- **Education & Employment** – Enables verifiable academic credentials and professional certifications.
- **Healthcare & Government Services** – Facilitates secure, user-controlled access to medical records and official documents.

OnePass Credentials provides a complete infrastructure to help organizations issue, manage, and verify decentralized identity credentials. By integrating OnePass Credentials, businesses and institutions can build secure, trusted ecosystems that enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in digital interactions.

## Conclusion

Decentralized identity is reshaping the way we establish and verify digital identities. By shifting control from centralized authorities to individuals, it enhances security, privacy, and interoperability. Organizations looking to leverage this technology can use OnePass Credentials to build next-generation trust networks.
