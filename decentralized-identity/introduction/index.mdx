# What is Decentralized Identity?

Decentralized identity (DID) is a new approach to digital identity that shifts control from centralized institutions to individuals and organizations. By leveraging blockchain and cryptographic technologies, decentralized identity enables secure, verifiable, and self-sovereign digital identities that enhance privacy, security, and interoperability across digital ecosystems.

## How Does Decentralized Identity Work?

Decentralized identity is built upon three key components:

1. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** – Unique, self-owned identifiers that do not rely on a central registry or authority.
2. **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** – Digital attestations issued by trusted entities that can be cryptographically verified.
3. **Decentralized Identity Wallets** – Secure applications that store, manage, and share identity credentials.

When a user receives a verifiable credential (e.g., proof of age, educational qualification, business registration), they store it in their wallet. When needed, they can share it with a verifier (e.g., a bank, employer) who can check its authenticity without relying on a central database.

## Benefits of Decentralized Identity

- **User Control & Privacy** – Individuals own and manage their identity without dependence on third parties.
- **Enhanced Security** – Reduced risk of data breaches since identity data is not stored in centralized databases.
- **Interoperability** – Enables seamless identity verification across different platforms and ecosystems.
- **Fraud Prevention** – Cryptographic proofs prevent identity forgery and credential tampering.

## Use Cases of Decentralized Identity

- **Online Authentication** – Secure login without passwords using verifiable credentials.
- **KYC & Financial Services** – Faster, more private Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for banking and investments.
- **Government & Public Services** – Digital IDs for citizens that can be verified across multiple agencies.
- **Education & Employment** – Verified academic credentials and professional certifications for job applications.

## The Role of OnePass Credentials

OnePass Credentials provides the infrastructure to issue, manage, and verify decentralized identity credentials, enabling organizations to build trusted digital ecosystems. By adopting OnePass Credentials, businesses and institutions can enhance trust, security, and efficiency in digital interactions.

## Conclusion

Decentralized identity is revolutionizing the way we manage and verify digital identities. By eliminating reliance on centralized authorities and giving individuals control over their own credentials, decentralized identity enhances security, privacy, and trust in the digital world.
