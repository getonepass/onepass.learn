# How to Get Started with Decentralized Identity

## Introduction

Decentralized identity (DID) is transforming the way individuals and organizations manage identity verification. By leveraging verifiable credentials and blockchain technology, decentralized identity enhances security, privacy, and user control over personal data. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to getting started with decentralized identity.

## Step 1: Understand the Basics of Decentralized Identity

Before adopting decentralized identity, it’s essential to grasp its key concepts:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Self-owned, blockchain-based identifiers that replace traditional centralized IDs.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Digital attestations issued by trusted entities that can be shared and verified securely.
- **Identity Wallets:** Secure apps that allow users to manage their DIDs and VCs.

## Step 2: Choose a Decentralized Identity Wallet

An identity wallet is essential for managing your decentralized identity. Key features to look for:

- **Support for DIDs and VCs** (W3C standards-compliant)
- **Security features** (encryption, biometrics, backup options)
- **Interoperability** (works across different ecosystems)

### Popular Decentralized Identity Wallets

- OnePass Credentials Wallet
- Microsoft Authenticator (DID support)
- Evernym Connect.Me
- Spruce ID

## Step 3: Obtain Your First Decentralized Identifier (DID)

Once you have a wallet, you can generate your own DID:

- Some wallets allow you to create a DID instantly.
- Your DID is stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger, making it tamper-proof.
- You control your DID and can update or revoke it anytime.

## Step 4: Acquire Verifiable Credentials

To use decentralized identity, you need verifiable credentials issued by trusted organizations:

- **Government IDs** (e.g., digital passports, driver’s licenses)
- **Academic Credentials** (e.g., diplomas, certifications)
- **Business & Employment Credentials** (e.g., company registration, employee ID)

You can request these credentials from institutions that support decentralized identity solutions, such as OnePass Credentials.

## Step 5: Use Your Decentralized Identity

With your DID and verifiable credentials, you can:

- Log in to websites and apps without passwords.
- Verify your identity for financial services (KYC processes).
- Apply for jobs with verified academic and work credentials.
- Access government and healthcare services securely.

## Step 6: Share Your Credentials Securely

Decentralized identity enables selective disclosure, meaning you can:

- Share only the necessary information (e.g., proving age without revealing birthdate).
- Use zero-knowledge proofs for added privacy.
- Revoke access to credentials at any time.

## Step 7: Explore Advanced Use Cases

As decentralized identity adoption grows, more use cases emerge:

- **Cross-border identity verification** for seamless travel and international transactions.
- **Decentralized finance (DeFi)** for secure digital asset management.
- **Supply chain authentication** for verifying product origin and compliance.

## The Role of OnePass Credentials

OnePass Credentials provides the infrastructure for issuing, managing, and verifying decentralized identity credentials. By using OnePass Credentials, individuals and organizations can create trusted digital ecosystems that prioritize security and privacy.

## Conclusion

Getting started with decentralized identity is straightforward and offers significant benefits in security, privacy, and efficiency. By choosing a decentralized identity wallet, obtaining verifiable credentials, and using them in everyday transactions, users can take control of their digital identity.
