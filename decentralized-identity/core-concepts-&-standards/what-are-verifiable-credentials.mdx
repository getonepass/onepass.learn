# What Are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)?

## Introduction

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital credentials that provide a secure, privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof way to share and verify identity information. By leveraging decentralized identity principles, VCs enable individuals and organizations to establish trust in digital interactions without relying on centralized authorities.

This guide explains what verifiable credentials are, how they work, and their role in enabling secure and verifiable identity transactions.

## What Are Verifiable Credentials?

A **Verifiable Credential (VC)** is a digital statement issued by a trusted entity (issuer) to an individual or organization (holder), which can be cryptographically verified by another party (verifier). These credentials can represent identity documents, professional certifications, financial records, and more.

### Key Characteristics of VCs

- **Tamper-Proof:** Secured using cryptographic signatures to prevent forgery.
- **Privacy-Preserving:** Users can disclose only the necessary information (e.g., proving age without revealing birthdate).
- **Decentralized:** No need for centralized identity providers to verify claims.
- **Interoperable:** Based on W3C standards, ensuring compatibility across different systems and industries.

## How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?

Verifiable Credentials operate within a decentralized identity framework involving three main participants:

1. **Issuer:** The trusted entity that issues a credential (e.g., a government agency, university, or bank).
2. **Holder:** The individual or organization that receives and stores the credential in their digital identity wallet.
3. **Verifier:** The entity requesting verification of the credential (e.g., an employer, service provider, or financial institution).

### Verification Process

1. **Credential Issuance:** The issuer digitally signs and issues a verifiable credential to the holder.
2. **Credential Storage:** The holder securely stores the credential in a digital identity wallet.
3. **Presentation & Verification:** When required, the holder presents the credential to a verifier, who checks its authenticity using cryptographic verification methods.
4. **Trust Establishment:** The verifier confirms the credentialâ€™s validity without needing to contact the issuer directly.

## Structure of a Verifiable Credential

A verifiable credential typically contains:

- **Issuer Information:** The entity that issued the credential.
- **Subject Information:** Details about the individual or organization the credential pertains to.
- **Claims:** The statements being made (e.g., name, degree, certification).
- **Expiration Date:** The validity period of the credential.
- **Cryptographic Proof:** A digital signature that allows verification.

### Example of a Verifiable Credential (JSON Format)

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegree"],
  "issuer": "did:example:university123",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:student456",
    "degree": {
      "type": "Bachelor of Science",
      "name": "Computer Science"
    }
  },
  "issuanceDate": "2023-06-01",
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:university123#keys-1",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQS..."
  }
}
```

## The Role of Verifiable Credentials in Digital Trust

Verifiable Credentials are essential for establishing trust in digital interactions by:

- **Eliminating Centralized Verification:** Reducing reliance on third-party verification services.
- **Enhancing Security & Fraud Prevention:** Making credentials nearly impossible to forge.
- **Enabling Selective Disclosure:** Allowing users to share only the necessary details.
- **Improving Efficiency:** Automating verification processes and reducing manual checks.

## Real-World Applications of Verifiable Credentials

### 1. **Identity & Access Management**

- Passwordless authentication using verifiable credentials.
- Secure login to online services without relying on centralized databases.

### 2. **Education & Certification**

- Universities issue digital diplomas that employers can verify instantly.
- Professional certifications stored as verifiable credentials for job applications.

### 3. **Financial Services & KYC Compliance**

- Banks issue reusable KYC credentials, reducing onboarding time.
- Users provide verifiable proof of identity without sharing sensitive documents.

### 4. **Healthcare & Medical Records**

- Patients store and share verified medical credentials securely.
- Vaccination records issued as verifiable credentials for travel and health services.

### 5. **Government & Public Services**

- Digital IDs issued by governments for secure online identity verification.
- Social benefits eligibility proven through verifiable credentials.
