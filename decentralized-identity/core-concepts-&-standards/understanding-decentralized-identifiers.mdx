# Understanding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

## Introduction

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a core component of decentralized identity systems. Unlike traditional identifiers (such as email addresses or usernames), DIDs are self-owned, tamper-resistant, and do not rely on centralized authorities. This guide explains how DIDs work, their structure, and their role in digital trust ecosystems.

## What Are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?

A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a globally unique identifier created, owned, and controlled by an individual or organization without the need for a central registry or authority. DIDs enable users to establish verifiable, privacy-preserving digital identities.

### Key Characteristics of DIDs

- **Self-Sovereign** – Users create and manage their own identifiers without relying on third parties.
- **Verifiable & Tamper-Proof** – Stored on a decentralized ledger or distributed network, ensuring integrity.
- **Privacy-Preserving** – Users selectively disclose identity attributes without exposing unnecessary data.
- **Interoperable** – Based on W3C standards, enabling use across different platforms and services.

## How Do DIDs Work?

DIDs function as a foundational layer for trust in digital interactions. Here’s how they work:

1. **DID Creation:** A user or entity generates a DID using a decentralized identity wallet.
2. **DID Storage:** The DID is registered on a blockchain, distributed ledger, or decentralized network.
3. **DID Document:** Each DID is associated with a DID Document containing metadata, cryptographic keys, and service endpoints.
4. **Verification:** Other parties can verify the DID’s authenticity without relying on a central authority.
5. **Credential Issuance:** Users receive verifiable credentials linked to their DID from trusted issuers.
6. **Selective Disclosure:** Users present credentials to verifiers, proving specific claims without exposing their full identity.

## Structure of a DID

A DID typically follows this structure:

```text
did:method:unique_identifier
```

- **`did:`** – A required prefix indicating it is a Decentralized Identifier.
- **`method:`** – Specifies the DID method, which determines how the DID is created and resolved (e.g., `did:ion`, `did:ethr`).
- **`unique_identifier:`** – A unique string that identifies the DID owner within the chosen method.

### Example of a DID

```text
did:example:123456789abcdefghi
```

## The Role of DID Documents

A **DID Document** contains key information needed to verify the DID’s authenticity. It includes:

- **Public Keys:** Used for cryptographic verification of credentials.
- **Service Endpoints:** URLs pointing to trusted services associated with the DID.
- **Authentication Methods:** Mechanisms to prove control over the DID.

### Example of a DID Document

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    "type": "Ed25519SignatureAuthentication2018",
    "publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
  }],
  "service": [{
    "type": "IdentityHub",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://hub.getonepass.eu/"
  }]
}
```

## Why Are DIDs Important for Digital Trust Ecosystems?

DIDs play a crucial role in creating trusted, decentralized digital interactions by:

- **Eliminating Centralized Control:** Users no longer depend on governments or corporations for identity verification.
- **Enhancing Privacy & Security:** Data breaches are minimized, and personal information is not stored in centralized databases.
- **Enabling Cross-Border Interoperability:** DIDs work across different networks and jurisdictions.
- **Supporting Verifiable Credentials:** DIDs act as anchors for digital credentials that can be verified instantly.

## Real-World Applications of DIDs

- **Financial Services:** Secure KYC verification for banking and DeFi platforms.
- **Healthcare:** Patient identity management and medical records access.
- **Education:** Issuance of digital diplomas and academic credentials.
- **Government Services:** Digital IDs for online access to public services.
