### Download your wallet

While you wait for your credential to be issued, you can register to a compatible wallet (you will need it to download your credential once ready). At this point, the wallets that are interoperable with OnePass Brige are the ones by [Talao](https://talao.io/talao-wallet/) and by [Walt.id](https://wallet.walt.id/). We suggest using the Talao's one as it might be a bit easier to operate (as it's non-custodial and mobile-based)

* search for the "Talao" wallet in the app search in your mobile (AppStore or Google Play) and install the app,
* click the "Create a digital wallet" button,
* select your authentication method and read and accept the terms and conditions,
* click the "Start" button,
* go to the "Settings" tab of your wallet, and
* click the "Wallet profiles" and choose the option "European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI v4.0).

Take into account that, if you rather decide to use the Walt.id wallet (which is custodial and web-based), you will need to install a direct access link to your wallet in the main screen of your phone.

### Get your business identity credential

You will receive a message once your business identity check is complete and your credential issued. The message should contain a link to download your credential and a pin. Here's how it works:

* click on the link to download your credential,
* type your pin,
* open your wallet in your mobile phone and scan the QR code.

:::info
In the case of Walt.id wallet, you will need to copy the link of the credential shown in the screen after typing your pin code and paste it in your wallet to present it.
