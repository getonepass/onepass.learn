# Investors (Venture Capital)  

## Types of Investors  

Startups can raise funds from various sources such as angel investors, venture capital firms, corporate ventures, family offices, or government initiatives. Each investor type provides unique advantages like flexibility, industry insights, or strategic alignment. Matching your startup‚Äôs stage and objectives to the appropriate investor is crucial.

## Types of Rounds  

Fundraising typically progresses through:

* Pre-seed/Seed: Initial product development and market validation.
* Series A: Achieving product-market fit and scaling operations.
* Series B-C and beyond: Accelerating growth, international expansion, or diversification.
* Understanding each round's typical investment size, expectations, and equity dilution is essential to strategic funding planning.
